# Prediction-of-Diabetes-Using-Machine-Learning
Diabetes is a growing global health challenge, with India among the most affected countries. Early diagnosis is essential to prevent complications and reduce treatment costs.

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes using patient medical data. Key health indicators such as glucose levels, BMI, age, blood pressure, and insulin levels are used for analysis.

We applied various supervised learning algorithms‚Äîincluding Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM‚Äîand evaluated them using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing model.

üîç Key Features:
Preprocessed dataset for optimal model performance

Multiple classification algorithms tested

Performance comparison and evaluation

Supports early diagnosis and personalized healthcare

This predictive system can be used in clinical tools or mobile health apps to support medical professionals and patients, especially in low-resource settings. The goal is to make healthcare smarter, faster, and more preventive through data-driven decisions.
